# Spotify Clone

The Spotify clone project is a web application designed to replicate the functionality and user interface of the Spotify web player. It is built using HTML and CSS to create a responsive and interactive music streaming experience. Users can browse through a collection of playlists, artists, and albums, search for specific songs or artists, and play music with a built-in player.
